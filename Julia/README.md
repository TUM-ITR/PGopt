[![Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](https://TUM-ITR.github.io/PGopt)

This folder contains the Julia implementation of `PGopt`, which does not require proprietary software. The open-source solver [Altro](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/Altro.jl) is used for the optimization. The results presented in the paper were generated with this version, and the software reproduces these results exactly.

**Please note that this version has several limitations: only cost functions of the form $J_H=\sum\nolimits_{t=0}^H \frac{1}{2} u_t R u_t$, measurement functions of the form $y=x_{1:n_y}$, and output constraints of the form $y_\mathrm{min} \leq y \leq y_\mathrm{max}$ are supported.**

To execute the code, install [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Navigate to this folder, start a Pkg REPL (press `]` in a Julia REPL), and install the dependencies via
```
pkg>activate . 
pkg>instantiate
```

Then execute the scripts `autocorrelation.jl`, `PG_OCP_known_basis_functions.jl`, or `PG_generic_basis_functions.jl` in the folder `examples`.

Tested with Windows 11 and Julia 1.10.

## List of examples
The following examples can be found in the folder [examples](examples).

### autocorrelation.jl
This script reproduces the normalized auto-correlation function plot (Figure 1) in Section V-B of the paper.

</p>

Assuming knowledge of the basis functions, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution over model parameters and latent state trajectories using the function `particle_Gibbs()` without thinning. Afterward, the autocorrelation is plotted using the function `plot_autocorrelation()`.

The runtime of the script is about 10 minutes on a standard laptop.

### PG_OCP_known_basis_functions.jl
This script reproduces the results of the optimal control approach with known basis functions (Figure 2) given in Section V-B of the paper.

</p>

```
### Support sub-sample found
Cardinality of the support sub-sample (s): 7
Max. constraint violation probability (1-epsilon): 10.22 %
```

First, the algorithm and simulation parameters are defined, and training data is generated. Then, by calling the function `particle_Gibbs()`, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution using particle Gibbs sampling. These samples are then passed to the function `solve_PG_OCP_greedy_guarantees()`, which solves the scenario OCP and inferres probabilistic constraint satisfaction guarantees by greedily removing constraints and solving the corresponding reduced OCP.

The runtime of the script is about 2 hours on a standard laptop.

For the results in Table II of the paper, this script is repeated with seeds 1:100.

### PG_OCP_generic_basis_functions.jl
This script reproduces the results of the optimal control approach with generic basis functions (Figure 3) given in Section V-C of the paper.

</p>

The method presented in the paper ["A flexible stateâ€“space model for learning nonlinear dynamical systems"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.030) is utilized to systematically derive basis functions and priors for the parameters based on a reduced-rank GP approximation. Afterward, by calling the function `particle_Gibbs()`, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution using particle Gibbs sampling. These samples are then passed to the function `solve_PG_OCP()`, which solves the scenario OCP.

The runtime of the script is about 2 hours on a standard laptop. Using an improved phi function can reduce the runtime to about 50 minutes, but the results change slightly due to numerical reasons. Further explanations can be found in the source code.

For the results in Table IV of the paper, this script is repeated with seeds 1:100.
